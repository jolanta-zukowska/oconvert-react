>>> The commands "git init" and "gitt add ." are basically corresponding for windows project ?
Previously I mostly worked on Linux and I've not asked myself if I have to adapt my terminal & git commands for pc Windows.

>>> Yes, the commands "git init" and "git add ." are essentially the same for Windows and Linux projects. 
Git is designed to work consistently across different operating systems, so the core commands remain the same whether you're using Windows, Linux, or macOS.

However, there are a few minor differences to be aware of when using Git on Windows:

* Line endings ===> Windows uses CRLF (Carriage Return Line Feed) for line endings, while Linux uses LF (Line Feed). 
Git can automatically handle this difference, but you may see warnings about CRLF to LF conversions.

* File paths: Windows uses backslashes ===> $$ in file paths ===> while Linux uses forward slashes (/)
Git generally handles this automatically, but *** it's best to use forward slashes in Git commands even on Windows ***

* Terminal: On Windows, you might use Git Bash, PowerShell, or Command Prompt, while on Linux you typically use a standard terminal. 
The commands themselves are the same, but the terminal environment might look different.


>>> To use Git on Windows, you don't need to adapt your commands significantly. 
Just ensure Git is properly installed on your Windows system, and you can use the same "git init" and "git add ." commands as you did on Linux.
